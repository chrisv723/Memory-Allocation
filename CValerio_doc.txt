To Compile: g++ -o CValerio_mem.exe CValerio_mem.cpp
To Execute: CValerio_mem.exe 1048576

My Program uses two global list variables called freeList, and usedList.
-freeList is used to maintain a list of free/unoccupied memory blocks
-usedList is used to maintain a list of used/occupied memory blocks

-I declare a class called  memBlock. Each memBlock object contains 
starting index, ending index, size, and status of a memory blocks

-I declare the following functions to support the RQ, RL, C, STAT commands
	
	void RQ(string proc, string length);
		RQ - (request for new process)
		
	void RL(string proc);
		RL - releases/terminates the specified process, clearing it out from memory
	
	void STAT();
		STAT - generate output about how memory is being used
		
	void C(int maxSize);
		C -  compaction command, here we push all processes down towards low memory so they are all flush against each other
		Leaving all free memory on top of the process blocks

RQ, RL, C, STAT, and QUIT commands must be specified in capital letters. 
for example an RQ command of "rq P0 262144 W", would not be recognized because "rq" must be specified as "RQ"
		
-Initially the project has one large free available block of memory
